# Users of MD-Party

The following websites use MD-Party to collect their content from markdown files:

- [**Performance Team** (University of MÃ¼nster)][pt]
    Instead of using SFTP to upload static websites to a university server, the collaboratively managed contents are loaded from [the organization's][pt-org] [website repository][pt-website] on GitHub.

- **[MD-Party documentation][mdp-doc]**
    This project uses MD-Party itself to build the documentation website.

- **You?**
    Please [let me know][mail] when you use MD-Party on your website!
